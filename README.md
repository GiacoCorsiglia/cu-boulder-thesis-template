# LaTeX Template for CU Boulder Graduate Theses

An improved version of CU Boulder's [original](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/academic-resources/thesis-dissertation-specifications/thesis-dissertation-templates) LaTeX thesis template.  Updated to match the latest graduate school requirements, this template also includes a variety of other small improvements and capabilities as compared with the original.  A few notable improvements include:

- The base `thesis.tex` file now references lots of useful packages.
- _Italics_ are used instead of **boldface** to emphasize text (i.e., for the `\emph{}` command).  I confirmed with the graduate school that the [instructions](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/sites/default/files/attached-files/latexthesisinstructions_2020.pdf), which require boldface, are out of date.
- Typesetting of footnotes is improved.
- Added `\introductoryPage`, `\titlePageTitle`, and `\thesisDirectedBy` commands.

See the changelog in `thesis.cls` for more details.

I submitted my physics [PhD dissertation](https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/2/7hwaR?_s=A2RkJg2HN1WqrgUA0fI4K213EXU%3D) to the graduate school using this template in May 2023.
