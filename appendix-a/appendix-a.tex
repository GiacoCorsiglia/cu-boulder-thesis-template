\paragraph{About appendices:}
	Each appendix follow the same page-numbering rules as a regular chapter; the
	first page of a (multi-page) appendix is not numbered.  Here are some facts about dogs!

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Dalmatians are born without spots!  They are born with plain white coats with their first spots appearing after they are 1week old.
	\item Dogs sweat through their foot pads to help keep them cool.  They also keep cool by panting.
	\item Greyhounds are the world's fastest dogs with the ability to reach up to 45 mph.
	\item Every dog has a unique nose print with no two alike.
	\item The Basenji, an African wolf dog, does not bark in a normal way but may yodel or scream when excited!

	\item A dog's sense of smell is 1000 times greater than a human!
	\item Nine percent of dog owners will have a birthday party for their pet.
	\item Dogs have 28 baby teeth and 42 permanent teeth.

first Google search result for ``list of fun facts about animals''.
